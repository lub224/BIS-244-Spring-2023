# Hands-on Week - Working with **gapminder** Data
# Please be advised that this file should be run without any modification on any RStudio software. Therefore, it is essential to include all necessary libraries and prerequisit syntaxes. 

# a) What happens when you put the *geom_smooth()* function before *geom_point()* instead of after it in *Healy_CH3.R*? What does this tell you about how the plot is drawn? Think about how this might be useful when drawing plots.

The color scheme within the data visualization will be adjusted.
